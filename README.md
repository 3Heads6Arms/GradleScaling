# Gradle for Android and Java Final Project

In this project is an app with multiple flavors that uses
multiple libraries and Google Cloud Endpoints. 

## Why this Project

As Android projects grow in complexity, it becomes necessary to customize the
behavior of the Gradle build tool, allowing automation of repetitive tasks.
Particularly, factoring functionality into libraries and creating product
flavors allow for much bigger projects with minimal added complexity.
